-modems get internet with ONE IP ADDRESS from the WIDE AREA NETWORK

-routers get internet from modem & create subnetwork 
    sometimes have switches built into them to connect devices directly

-switches are just ethernet port extentions to the router for LOCAL AREA NETWORK

TYPOLOGY ASSIGN IP ADDRESSES
    add a cisco router into typology
    add cisco switch to typology
    add pc to typology

    turn off router of router
    select  WIC-1T interface on side bar menu
        drag  WIC-1T picture into the back of router
    
    CONNECT ROUTERS WITH CABLES
        connect all routers with this config by using SERIAL DCE (red zap with clock icon)
            click SERIAL DCE icon then click on router... CHOOSE "Serial0/0/0"
                then click on connected router and CHOOSE "Serial0/0/0"


    Click on Copper Straight-Through
        select first router and CHOOSE "FastEthernet0/0"
            click on the switch and CHOOSE "FastEthernet0/1"
                NOTE: 
                    routers connect to eachother using SERIAL DCE
                    each router connects to a switch using Copper Straight-Through

    ASSIGN IPs:
        click on router
            go to cli
                write "no"                                       -because we will config manually

NETWORK AUTOMATION DEVELOPER NOTES

    company standards are to use ssh instead of telnet

    someone will hand you the commands for the router/switch cli
        your job is to execute such commands on a massive scale
            write python script that logs into switch 
                push cli commands 
                save config , log out ,write in output file if success or not ,  move to next switch

        list of ip addresses for switch/router SUCCESS STATUS
            go through each ip , log in... execute config file commands 
                confirm successful save of config
                    create a text file stating ip add/DNS name stating saved or failed
                move onto next switch 
                
                end of script output file displays all success and ones that we need to debug

        we are using ssh to do this

DCE VS DTE ROUTER CONNECTIONS
    when connecting two routers with serial port
        ** first connection is called DCE "data communication equipment"
        ** second connection is called DTE "data terminal equipment"

    DCE decides how fast data travels on DTE

    DCE decides clockrate and bandwidth

    how ever many routers we decide to connect through one another...
        first will be DCE and the next will be DTE

    FIND OUT WHOS THE ROUTERS DTE
        open cli
            write "enable"                              -access privalege mode
            write "show controllers serial 0/0/0"         -display controller connected by serial 0/0/0
                you should double check what port serial is connected with EX: 0/0/1
            OUTPUT
                third line will tell if this is a DCE or DTE connection
            
            NOTE: you can then decide if you need a clockrate & bandwidth  if its DCE!
